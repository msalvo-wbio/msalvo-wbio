## About Me
I am a master's student at the Univeristy of Montana researching how we can improve the data output from bird radar systems to better inform habitat and bird strike management at airfields. 

I'm interested in using quantitative ecology to answer pressing management issues which have imapcts for both people and wildlife. Past research includes studying how habitat treatments influence the nutritional landscape for elk and elk use of habitat treatments, as well as reviewing the breadth and complexity of hunting regulation in the United States.

Skilled in R. Analytical skills include occupancy, linear modeling (including generalized and mixed effects models), diet and nutritional analyses, supervised (random forests, decision trees, support vector machines) and unsupervised (k-means) machine learning.
